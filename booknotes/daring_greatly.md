I knew vulnerability was kinda useful when it came to taking huge risks in life and career. However, it wasn't until when my girlfriend recently introduced me to Brene Brown's talks/books that I realized how important it is in everyday life.

10 guidelines to **wholehearted** living:
1. 1
1. 2

* Narcissism is probably stems out of the fear of being ordinary. You end up defining yourself in terms of the number of likes you get on Facebook or instagram.
* Scarcity - the never enough problem. “Never thin enough”, “Never good enough”, “Never successful enough”, “Never smart enough”, “Never safe enough”. “I didn’t get enough sleep”, “I don’t have enough time”.
* Nostalgia is also a dangerous form of comparison. (Older folks reminiscing about younger days. US election, Brexit are the examples.) (We compare against a perfectly edited memory that never existed.)
* Source of scarcity - thrives in cultures with high shame and cultures fractured by disengagement.
