I knew vulnerability was kinda useful when it came to taking huge risks in life and career. However, it wasn't until when my girlfriend recently introduced me to Brene Brown's talks/books that I realized how important it is in everyday life.

10 guidelines to **wholehearted** living:
1. 1
1. 2

* **Narcissism** stems out of the fear of being ordinary. You end up defining yourself in terms of the number of likes you get on Facebook or instagram.
* **Scarcity** - the never enough problem. "Never thin enough", "Never good enough", "Never successful enough", "Never smart enough", "Never safe enough". "I didn’t get enough sleep", "I don’t have enough time". Source of scarcity - it thrives in cultures with high shame and cultures fractured by disengagement.
* **Nostalgia** is also a dangerous form of comparison. (Older folks reminiscing about younger days. US election, Brexit are the examples.) (We compare against a perfectly edited memory that never existed.)
* Chapter 3 discusses **shame**. It's important to distinguish between shame and guilt. Shame is "I am wrong", guilt is "I did wrong".
* **Empathy** is a major antidote to shame. Self-empathy goes a long way in fighting shame.
* Empathy towards others helps solve other problems as well. For example, many fights between loved ones (husband-wife, daughter-mother) result from having a sense of being unheard and misunderstood - empathy can solve this. However, both sides need to have empathy in that case.
* It's important to cultivate shame-resilience strategies. In addition to empathy towards oneself, **expressive writing** also helps fight the shame. "I am not what happend to me. I am what I choose to become."
* _We are hard on others because we are hard on ourselves_. For example, if we're comfortable with our weight, we don't judge someone else having a bit of weight. (I used to be hard on others - However, I would give benefit of doubt to strangers, but was really hard on people close to me. I have changed this aspect after realizing this few years ago.)
* There are 3 types vulnerability armors we often wear:
  1. **Foreboding Joy** - When we feel happy or joyful, we are often scared that it will not last. By doing so (or by catastrophising it), we end up not enjoying the moment. **Expressing gratitude** is an antidote to foreboding joy.
  1. **Perfectionism** - It's important to note the perfectionism is not the same as the ability to improve. There is actually no such thing as perfect. **I am enough** is a good way to overcome this issue. _Finishing an incomplete task is better than never finishing a perfect job_.
  1. **Numbing the feelings** - This often results from shame, anxiety and disconnection.
* Apart from the above 3 vulnerability armors, the following less frequent ones do affect some people:
  1. **Viking or Victim**
