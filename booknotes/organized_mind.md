* I have always known that writing down the tasks helps me focus on things better. But, I didn't know why. The author highlights this well and addresses why it works. Apparently, our mind keeps coming back to the pending items from time to time because we're afraid we will forget them. This hurts attention and focus. By **writing things down**, we free our mind to focus better.  Another benefit is that, the process of writing down streamlines and concretizes the vague/latent idea floating around in mind.
* Most of the PFC's functions are inhibitory. For example, impulse control is developed during adolescence. PFC helps delay gratification.
* We are inherently not good at statistics. Prostate cancer side effect example.
* Importance of developing the bayesian mindset. Most people ignore the base rate when evaluating the probabilities. This is also one of the first things highlighted in the "Thinking Fast and Slow" book.
* Good behaviors are just a **contagious** as the bad ones. So, the companies that promote good ethical culture from the start pass on this behavior to new employees and vice versa.
* **Locus of control** - if a person attributes the successes and failures to herself, she has an internal locus of control. Locus of control doesn't seem to change over the years, despite new experiences of successes and failures. Internals are higher achievers. Externals are more prone to depression. Internals tend to learn better, seek more information and take more initiatives. Externals make for better followers and easier to supervise.
