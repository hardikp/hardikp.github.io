The best thing about this book is its ability to provoke additional thoughts for the day-to-day aspects of human life. This sentence captures the essence of it — “Almost everything people did throughout history was fueled by solar energy that was captured by plants and converted into muscle power. The only energy conversation trick they had was “the body”” (page 335).
The book is divided into sections with boundaries that underlie significant cultural and social changes. More specifically, these are sections: **The Cognitive Revolution**, **The Agricultural Revolution**, **The Unification of Humankind** and **The Scientific Revolution**.

## The Cognitive Revolution
The ability to think and imagine is considered to be a major turning point for the proliferation of Homo Sapiens. Almost all human species (Homo Sapiens, Neanderthals, Denisovans and others) had the ability to use fire to their advantage — which did effectively use against the other occupants (e.g. wild animals). However, Sapiens developed a superior abilities in developing and using more expressive languages and communication methods around 70,000 to 30,000 years ago, effectively giving them a huge advantage against other human species. Turns out, the ability to believe in an imaginary entity is unique to Sapiens.
During this time, Homo Sapiens moved into new locations, perhaps as a result of overpopulation, forcing people to seek out new places to hunt and gather. The migration of Homo Sapiens was quickly followed by extinction of megafauna wherever humans went. This especially visible in continents with the most recent occupancy, America and Australia. Both of these continents quickly lost their giant animals. There used to be giant ground sloths, oversized lions, giant rodents, giant mammoths and native American horses — all of them went extinct soon after humans came to America.
