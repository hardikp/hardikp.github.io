We never evolved to do involuntary physical activity (i.e. exercise), because our bodies evolved to conserve as much as energy as possible. This makes it really hard to for us to do exercise. Yet, evolution also explains why exercise is so healthy and rewarding.

*Make exercise necessary and fun. Do mostly cardio, but also some weights. Some is better than none. Keep it up as you age.*

This book helps answer many crucial questions surrounding exercise:
* Is it better to exercise or lose weight (i.e. not be obese)?
    * A: Obesity is worse for longevity and quality of life, than not exercising.
* How much exercise is good? What type of exercise is good?
    * A: For increased longevity and quality of life, do at least 150 mins of moderate intensity cardio each week. More is better, but the incremental benefits beyond 150 mins are low.
    * A: Cardio is must, but weights also help. Only doing weights is bad.

Yet, some of the unanswered questions for me are:
* Is it okay to exercise 150 mins only on weekends and have sedentary lifestyle during weekdays? How good/bad is it compared to doing daily exercise totaling up to 150 mins each week?
* What physical benefits does Yoga provide? Is it complementary to cardio? If so, in what way?
