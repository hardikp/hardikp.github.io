I like to read **non-fiction books**. My goals for reading books include:

1. *Satisfying curiosity*
1. *Understanding the world around us*
1. *Develop an informed world view* - to help develop a more rational intuition.

I am incredibly slow at reading, but really fast at understanding concepts. So, I prefer to read books that contain
a lot more information.
