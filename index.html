My name is Hardik Patel.<br><br>

I lead recs and conversational projects at Youtube Music. One part of my work consists of ranking/retrieval improvements in Youtube that usually go unnoticed by most users. However, the other part sometimes gets noticed by users (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1f4r3ib/best_ytm_feature_so_far/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1f5qg5z/new_playlist_ai_is_what_weve_been_waiting_for/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1fe9k3r/oh/">3</a>) and press (<a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/10/youtube-music-ask-music/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-youtube-musics-ai-radio-rocks/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/audio-streaming/youtube-musics-ai-radio-officially-gets-a-name-heres-what-you-can-ask-music-to-do">3</a>).<br><br>

I received my BS and MS in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/">IIT Kanpur</a> in 2012. I spent about 1.5 years working for Microsoft after that. I left Microsoft to spend the next 2 years in High Frequency Trading. I worked at <a href="https://www.qplum.co/">qplum</a> from August 2015 to Feb 2019.<br><br>
