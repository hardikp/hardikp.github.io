I am **Hardik Patel**.

I work at Google.

I received my BS and MS in Computer Science from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) in 2012. I spent about 1.5 years working for Microsoft after that. I left Microsoft to spend the next 2 years in High Frequency Trading. I worked at [qplum](https://www.qplum.co/) from August 2015 to Feb 2019.
