I am **Hardik Patel**. I work at the intersection of Finance and Computer Science. I am interested in exploring how Finance, Biotech and other disciplines can benefit from the application of Computer Science advances.

I received my BS and MS in Computer Science from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) in 2012. I spent about 1.5 years working for Microsoft after that. I left Microsoft to spend the next 2 years in High Frequency Trading. I have been working at [qplum](https://www.qplum.co/) since August 2015.
